# Game-on-FPGA
A simple rocket landing game implemented on the Picoblaze microprocessor.

Inspired by SpaceX, we made a simple game where players try to land a rocket that is in free fall on a small landing platform.  

The game play logic was implemented in assembly code for the Picoblaze microprocessor that was instatiated on the FPGA.

The FPGA houses other required logic blocks like the line drawing algorithm, display driver and the 7 segement and LED drivers.

This design is targeted towards the Basysâ„¢3 Artix-7 FPGA Board.
